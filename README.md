# Database design

This repository shows the design of a relational database for a car washing business. This is the work of Phys. Ad√°n Castillo and Act. Gabriela Caire.

Both DDL (data definition language) and DML (data manipulation language) are used. The design of the database followed six steps:

1. Requirements analysis, including a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation). This analysis is not in the repository but you can contact us if you're interested in reading it.
2. Design, through a UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram
3. Implementation in PostreSQL
4. Testing: data to fill the database was randomly generated through python scripts.
